# Buy vs. Build and OSS

As typical, the end of the year is often a time to extended reflection.  A topic
that came up more than a few times this year was the age old IT debate on "Buy vs. Build".  I come
from the application development world, and building is second nature to me.  As CSG
has progressed down our DevOps journey I've come to better appreciate the costs of
the build option when you consider the TCO of a given solution.  "Solution" as an interesting
word that I'll talk more about in a bit.  Engineers tend to think solely about the
initial effort involved in writing the code.  They don't think about the cost of operating it,
patching it, keeping it up to date (OS, base framework - i.e. .NET, Java, etc.).  Once you
realize this, it becomes quite tempting to swing completely to the other side of the
continuum and choose to heavily value the buying option.  A lack of in-house engineering
talent can heavily skew a decision makers thinking in this area as well - which is understandable.

As I said previously, I spent a long time with a heavily skewed mind in favor of building
over buying.  After spending some time on the other side this year, my views have settled on the
middle.  The thing we're talking about building/buying matters a great deal.  Things like operating
systems or systems that are defacto standards like Microsoft Office are no brainers.  Don't build those.
Additionally, integration-heavy systems like bug tracking system or version control or continuous
integration servers - don't build those either.  Just because building isn't a good idea, that
doesn't automatically mean buying is the answer.  At the very least, what you're buying and from what
vendor matters a lot.  Like... a lot.

Simply put:  open source software is the only sensible  

"Solution"

OSS
